Notable changes
===============

- Added a `z_converttex` RPC method to support conversion of transparent
  p2pkh addresses to the ZIP 320 (TEX) format.

- zcashd will now disconnect from a peer on receipt of a malformed `version`
  message, and also will reject duplicate `verack` messages from outbound
  connections. See https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/6781 for additional
  details.


Changelog
=========

Daira-Emma Hopwood (4):
      Remove code that is definitely dead, because pfrom->nVersion must be >= MIN_PEER_PROTO_VERSION (170100) at this point.
      Fix some issues with handling of version messages: * fields were deserialized into variables of platform-dependent length; * pfrom->nVersion was set even if it does not meet the minimum version   requirements; * make sure that pfrom->nTimeOffset is set before   pfrom->fSuccessfullyConnected.
      Treat a malformed version message as cause for disconnection.
      Reject duplicate verack.
